# AdvancedCalculator
The code implements a graphical calculator with basic arithmetic operations, unit conversions, error handling, and history functionality.

This repository contains the code for a graphical calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations, unit conversions, error handling, and provides a history functionality.

Features

    Arithmetic Operations: Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
    Unit Conversions: Convert between different units of measurement, such as length, weight, temperature, and more.
    Error Handling: Detect and handle errors, such as division by zero or invalid input.
    History Functionality: Keep track of previous calculations and easily access them.

Getting Started

To use the calculator code, follow these steps:

    Clone the repository to your local machine.
    Open the project in your preferred integrated development environment (IDE).
    Compile and run the code.

Usage

Once the code is running, you can interact with the graphical calculator interface. Enter numbers and select the desired operation using the provided buttons. The calculator will display the result in real-time.

Additionally, you can access the unit conversion feature by selecting the appropriate option. The calculator will prompt you for the source unit, destination unit, and the value to be converted.

To view the history of previous calculations, use the history functionality. It allows you to review past calculations and reuse them if needed.

Happy calculating!

## Here is a breakdown of the code:
1.	Import the required libraries: tkinter, math, tkinter.messagebox, tkinter.ttk, datetime, matplotlib.pyplot, numpy, and sympy.
2.	Define functions for performing arithmetic operations: add_numbers(), subtract_numbers(), multiply_numbers(), divide_numbers(), remainder_numbers(), sqrt_numbers(), exponent_numbers(), logarithm_numbers(), percentage_numbers(), factorial_number(), and dice().
3.	Define a function convert_units() for unit conversion using a dictionary conversion_rates that stores conversion rates for various units.
4.	Define functions pi_constant() and e_constant() to insert the values of pi and Euler's constant into the input field.
5.	Define a function toggle_theme() to switch between light and dark modes by changing the background color of the window and labels.
6.	Define functions show_history(), copy_to_clipboard(), and save_history() to display, copy, and save the calculation history, respectively.
7.	Define functions plot_graph() and solve_equation() for plotting a graph and solving an equation, respectively, using the matplotlib and sympy libraries.
8.	Create the main window using tkinter.Tk().
9.	Configure the styling options for the window and set the initial mode to light mode.
10.	Create the necessary widgets such as labels, entry fields, buttons, and option menus.
11.	Associate the appropriate functions with the buttons using the command parameter.
12.	Pack the widgets into the window using the pack() method.
13.	Run the main event loop using the tkinter.mainloop() function to handle user interactions and update the GUI.

## Here's a step-by-step guide to developing an application using PyInstaller:

1. Install PyInstaller: You can install PyInstaller using pip by running the following command:

    pip install pyinstaller
    
2. Prepare your Python script: Create or modify your Python script that you want to turn into a standalone application. Make sure your script is complete and working as expected.
3. Create a spec file: A spec file contains instructions for PyInstaller on how to build your application. To create a spec file, you can run the following command:
    pyinstaller your_script.py
This will generate a spec file named your_script.spec. You can customize this file if needed, specifying additional options and configurations.
4. Build the executable: Once you have the spec file, you can build the executable by running the following command:
    pyinstaller your_script.spec
PyInstaller will analyze your script, gather the required dependencies, and package them into a standalone executable. The output will be stored in the dist directory by default.
5. Test the executable: After the build process is complete, navigate to the dist directory and run your executable to ensure it works as expected. Make sure to test it on a machine that does not have Python or the required dependencies installed.
6. Distribute your application: Now that you have the standalone executable, you can distribute it to others. You can simply provide the executable file or package it with other resources, depending on your application's requirements.
It's important to note that PyInstaller does not guarantee that your application will work on every machine or operating system. You might need to consider platform-specific dependencies and configurations if you're targeting multiple platforms.
