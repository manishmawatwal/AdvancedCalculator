# AdvancedCalculator
The code implements a graphical calculator with basic arithmetic operations, unit conversions, error handling, and history functionality.

This repository contains the code for a graphical calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations, unit conversions, error handling, and provides a history functionality.

Features

    Arithmetic Operations: Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
    Unit Conversions: Convert between different units of measurement, such as length, weight, temperature, and more.
    Error Handling: Detect and handle errors, such as division by zero or invalid input.
    History Functionality: Keep track of previous calculations and easily access them.

Getting Started

To use the calculator code, follow these steps:

    Clone the repository to your local machine.
    Open the project in your preferred integrated development environment (IDE).
    Compile and run the code.

Usage

Once the code is running, you can interact with the graphical calculator interface. Enter numbers and select the desired operation using the provided buttons. The calculator will display the result in real-time.

Additionally, you can access the unit conversion feature by selecting the appropriate option. The calculator will prompt you for the source unit, destination unit, and the value to be converted.

To view the history of previous calculations, use the history functionality. It allows you to review past calculations and reuse them if needed.

Happy calculating!

## Here is a breakdown of the code:
1.	Import the required libraries: tkinter, math, tkinter.messagebox, tkinter.ttk, datetime, matplotlib.pyplot, numpy, and sympy.
2.	Define functions for performing arithmetic operations: add_numbers(), subtract_numbers(), multiply_numbers(), divide_numbers(), remainder_numbers(), sqrt_numbers(), exponent_numbers(), logarithm_numbers(), percentage_numbers(), factorial_number(), and dice().
3.	Define a function convert_units() for unit conversion using a dictionary conversion_rates that stores conversion rates for various units.
4.	Define functions pi_constant() and e_constant() to insert the values of pi and Euler's constant into the input field.
5.	Define a function toggle_theme() to switch between light and dark modes by changing the background color of the window and labels.
6.	Define functions show_history(), copy_to_clipboard(), and save_history() to display, copy, and save the calculation history, respectively.
7.	Define functions plot_graph() and solve_equation() for plotting a graph and solving an equation, respectively, using the matplotlib and sympy libraries.
8.	Create the main window using tkinter.Tk().
9.	Configure the styling options for the window and set the initial mode to light mode.
10.	Create the necessary widgets such as labels, entry fields, buttons, and option menus.
11.	Associate the appropriate functions with the buttons using the command parameter.
12.	Pack the widgets into the window using the pack() method.
13.	Run the main event loop using the tkinter.mainloop() function to handle user interactions and update the GUI.
